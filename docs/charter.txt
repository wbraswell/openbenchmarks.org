OpenBenchmarks.org Charter

OpenBenchmarks.org is the name of a community-driven website with the sole purpose of running and comparing performance speed measurements for all implementations of all computer programming languages.

OpenBenchmarks.org uses a free-and-open-source (FOSS) software package to perform the benchmark measurements, called the Open Benchmarks Platform (OBP). 

OpenBenchmarks.org is operated by a volunteer organization of language developers, called the Open Benchmarks Group (OBG).
